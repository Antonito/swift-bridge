# SwiftUI

This example demonstrates calling [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)'s APIs from Rust.

This simple example isn't meant to be practical.

It's more so meant to be a quick and fun demo that could hopefully inspire someone in the future to explore
a more robust integration between Rust and SwiftUI.

## To Run

```
open SwiftUIExample/SwiftUIExample.xcodeproj
# Click the "Run" button at the top left of Xcode
```
